           <h1> Travelling in Depression </h1> 
            <p> When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in 
            France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience. <br /><br /> 
            At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco 
            feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, 
            megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old 
            stones were still in place.  <br /><br />
            It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.  <br /><br />
            <img src="img/Girl.JPG" alt="Girl">
            It  began  with  French,  which  taught  me  the  importance  of  pronunciation.  I 
            remember  once  asking  a  store  owner in  Paris  where Rue  des  Pyramides  was. 
            But  when  I  pronounced  it  PYR–a–mides  instead  of  pyr–A–mides,  with  more 
            accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.  <br /><br />
            In the eighth grade, I became fascinated  with Spanish  and aware of its 
            similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is 
            béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible 
            to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find 
            that  cognates  come  to  the  rescue  when  I  forget  how  to  say  something  in 
            Spanish.  <br /><br />
            Then,  in  high  school,  I  developed  an  enthusiasm  for  Chinese.  As  I  studied 
            Chinese  at  my  school,  I  marveled  how  if  just  one  stroke  was  missing  from  a 
            character,  the  meaning  is  lost.  I  loved  how  long words  were  formed  by 
            combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning 
            mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love 
            spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
